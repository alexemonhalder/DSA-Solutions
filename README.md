üíª DSA-Solutions by Alex Emon Halder

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository.
This repository contains my Java solutions to classic and interview-focused problems.
It is designed to showcase my problem-solving skills, coding patterns knowledge, and technical organization, making it recruiter-friendly.

## üìå Example Solution

```java
// Problem: LeetCode 26 - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
// Approach: Two Pointers
// Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)

public class RemoveDuplicates {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
                i++;
                nums[i] = nums[j];
            }
        }
        return i + 1;
    }
}

```


## üéØ Goals
1. Build a strong foundation in DSA and problem-solving  
2. Practice common coding patterns for technical interviews  
3. Maintain a professional and recruiter-friendly portfolio
