# Two Pointers Pattern

## When to Use
- Arrays or strings problems requiring pairs, subarrays, or substrings.
- Often used for sorted arrays, palindrome checks, and sum-related problems.

## Approach
1. Initialize two pointers (start and end).
2. Move pointers based on a condition.
3. Update answer (max, min, sum, etc.).

## Example Problems
- [Two Sum](../arrays/two_sum_two_pointers.java)

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
